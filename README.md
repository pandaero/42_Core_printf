# Re-try 1
This is the code that was submitted for the second attempt of the project.

## Lessons learned
Including `libft` as a submodule is not a good idea. I also gained some insight into the Makefile which saw some changes.

Also, the fact that you can compile a `test.c` for the project this way, and save a lot of typing:
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra test.c libftprintf.a
```
